          I am an engaging student who does a lot besides school. Long before I started my studies, I was a hobbyist in IT. I realized early on the possibilities a computer had, and what I could use it for. In middle school, I explored web development, .NET, Unity 3D and modeling all by myself. It was a challenging task, because there were few online learning opportunities at the time the technology was not as mature as it is today. I have a great curiosity and commitment to technology and programming, and have done many remarkable projects. I want to explore further in the areas I have never had the opportunity to sit down for.
